Voicer is a desktop application designed to capture audio from specific programs running on your computer. It can display this audio visually, record it, provide real-time translation into various languages, and ultimately output recordings, transcripts, and summaries.

## âœ¨ Features

*   **Application-Specific Audio Capture:** Select and capture audio output solely from chosen applications, not the entire system audio.
*   **Real-time Audio Visualization:** See a visual representation (e.g., waveform, spectrum) of the captured audio on your screen.
*   **Audio Recording & Export:** Record the captured audio and save it in common audio formats (e.g., WAV, MP3).
*   **Live Multi-Language Translation:** Real-time translation of the captured audio into selected target languages.
*   **Transcript & Summary Generation:** Output text transcripts of the audio and generate concise summaries.

## ðŸ¤” Why Voicer?

*   **Accessibility:** Assist users with hearing impairments or those in noisy environments.
*   **Language Bridging:** Understand content in foreign languages during live calls, streams, or videos.
*   **Note-Taking & Archiving:** Easily record and summarize important audio from meetings, lectures, or webinars.
*   **Content Creation:** Capture specific audio for content creation, with built-in translation and summarization.
